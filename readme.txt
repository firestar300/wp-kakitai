Automatically add furigana (pronunciation guides) to Japanese kanji in the Gutenberg editor.

== Description ==

**WP Kakitai** makes reading Japanese easier by automatically adding furigana (pronunciation guides in hiragana) to kanji characters. Perfect for Japanese learners, educators, and content creators.

= Features =

* **One-click furigana**: Select Japanese text and add furigana with a single click
* **Toggle functionality**: Click again to remove furigana
* **Seamless integration**: Button directly in the Gutenberg editor toolbar
* **Standard HTML**: Uses `<ruby>`, `<rt>`, and `<rp>` tags for maximum compatibility
* **Accurate analysis**: Powered by Kuromoji.js morphological analyzer
* **Optimized performance**: Client-side processing with intelligent caching
* **Block support**: Works with Paragraph and Heading blocks

= How It Works =

WP Kakitai uses Kuromoji.js, a powerful Japanese morphological analyzer, to automatically detect kanji and add their hiragana readings. The plugin generates standard HTML ruby tags that are supported by all modern browsers.

= Use Cases =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are furigana? =

Furigana (ÊåØ„Çä‰ªÆÂêç) are small hiragana characters placed above or beside kanji to show pronunciation. They're commonly used in children's books, language learning materials, and texts with difficult kanji.

= Which blocks are supported? =

Currently, WP Kakitai supports Paragraph and Heading blocks (H1-H6). Support for more blocks may be added in future versions.

= Does this work with any Japanese text? =

Yes! The plugin uses Kuromoji.js for morphological analysis, which handles a wide range of Japanese text, including different kanji compounds and readings.

= Will furigana appear on the front-end? =

Yes! The plugin uses standard HTML `<ruby>` tags that are natively supported by all modern browsers. No additional CSS or JavaScript is needed on the front-end.

= Does this slow down my site? =

No. The morphological analysis happens in the editor only (admin side). The front-end simply displays the HTML ruby tags with no additional processing.

= Can I customize the appearance? =

Yes! You can style the `<ruby>`, `<rt>`, and `<rp>` tags with CSS in your theme. The furigana uses standard HTML elements.

= Is this compatible with page builders? =

The plugin is designed for the Gutenberg editor. Compatibility with other page builders has not been tested.
